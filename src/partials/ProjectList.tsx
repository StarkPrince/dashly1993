      "name": "Locating Shiva as the Ascetic and Liberal Being: A Study through Shiva Purana",
      "description": "The Puranic literature, a part of Indian literature, is comprehensive and it includes plethora of topics. The composition dates of these Puranas vary from the 4th century BCE to about 1000 AD. Researcher, scholars and readers from various fields have shown keen interest in this complex yet interesting genre of work. in recent times, the puranas have been a subject of fascination in academics. A close inquiry of the puranic texts can be followed up by various approaches. The deep mythic structure of ancient Indian civilization that the puranas offer can help us in locating, connecting and commenting on the various aspects of these mythical narratives, mythical figures and the social structures present in them. Myths and Archetype can help us examine the carefully placed understatements of our ancient and historic works of mythology. The meaning of myth can be operated on several levels. As far as the Hindu myths are considered, they are often nested within much larger myth cycles. Shiva Purana, demonstrating the characteristics of a Mahapurana, is a sacred treatise inclusive of Shiva's legends and rituals. The worship of Shiva assumes a wide range of forms and sectarian expressions, which ranges from devotional worship to the extreme arcanely worship followed by skull bearers and tantrics.  The paper aims at exploring the various dimensions of the mythological figure Shiva and his personality, where the focus will not be on him as a supreme deity but on him as a liberal and ascetic being. The relevance will be to see Shiva in a different light through the mythical narratives of Shiva Purana, to unwrap his layered personality and to bring him back from the religious to the social position by emphasizing on his supreme behaviour and not just on his divine stature.

      "description": "For a very long time, the area in Varanasi (Kashi) has served as the holiest of Hindu pilgrimage sites. Hindus believe that if they die in the holy city of Varanasi, they would be saved and released from the endless cycle of reincarnation. Varanasi, the Hindu holy city where Shiva and Parvati are believed to live, has mysterious origins. It is widely held that the waters of theGanges River in Varanasi can cleanse one of their earthly transgressions. Hindus believe that if they die in the holy city of Varanasi, they would be saved and released from the endless cycle of reincarnation. Varanasi (or Benares, Banaras, Kashi), on the left bank of the Ganges, is one of the seven sacred cities of the Hindus. Among the oldest continuously inhabited cities in theworld, its early history is that of the first Aryan settlement in the middle Ganges valley. By late2nd millennium BCE, Varanasi was a seat of Aryan religion and philosophy and a commercialand industrial centre famous for its muslin and silk fabrics, perfumes, ivory works, and sculpture. The capital of the kingdom of Kashi during the time of the Buddha (6th century BCE), who gave his first sermon at nearby Sarnath, it remained a centre of religious, educational, and artistic activities as attested by the celebrated Chinese traveler Hsüan-tsang, who visited it in c. 635 CE and said that the city extended for about 5 km along the western bank of the Ganges. Varanasi has the finest [religious] river frontage in India, with miles of ghats (steps) for bathing; an array of shrines, temples, and palaces rises tier on tier from the bank. More than a million pilgrims visit each year; many hope to die there in old age. A center of Hindu learning through the ages, it has lots of schools and countless Brahmin pandits. Its three universities include the large and important Banaras Hindu University (1915) and over a dozen colleges. A centre of arts, crafts, music and dance, it is also famous for its production of silks and brocades with gold and silver thread work, as well as for wooden toys, bangles made of glass, ivory work, and brassware. The land of Varanasi (Kashi) has been the ultimate pilgrimage spot for Hindus for ages. Hindus believe that one who is graced to die on the land of Varanasi would attain salvation and freedom from the cycle of birth and re-birth. Abode of Lord Shiva and Parvati, the origins of Varanasi are yet unknown. Ganges in Varanasi is believed  to have the power to wash away the sins of mortals.Varanasi has also been a great centre of learning for ages. Varanasi is associated with promotion of spiritualism, mysticism, Sanskrit,  yoga and Hindi language and honored authors such as the ever-famous novelist Prem Chand and Tulsi Das, the famous saint-poet who wrote Ram Charit Manas. Aptly called as the cultural capital of India, Varanasi has provided the right platform for all cultural activities to flourish. Many exponents of dance and music have come from Varanasi. Ravi Shankar, the internationally renowned Sitar maestro and Ustad Bismillah Khan, (the famous Shehnai player) are all sons of the blessed city or have lived here for major part of their lives.Varanasi is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. It was one of the first major urban settlements in the middle Ganges valley.It was the capital of the kingdom of Kashi during the time of the Buddha (6th century BCE), who gave his first sermon nearby at Sarnath. Varanasi remained a centre of religious, educational, and artistic activities as attested by the celebrated Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Xuanzang, who visited it about 635 CE and said that the city extended for about 3 miles (5 km) along the western bank of the Ganges.Varanasi subsequently declined during three centuries of Muslim occupation, beginning in 1194. Many of the city's Hindu temples were destroyed during the period of Muslim rule, and learned scholars fled to other parts of the country. The Mughal emperor Akbar in the 16th century brought some relief to the city's religious and cultural activities. There was another setback during the reign of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in the late 17th century, but later the Marathas sponsored a new revival. Varanasi became an independent kingdom in the 18th century, and under the subsequent British rule it remained a commercial and religious centre.In 1910 the British made Varanasi a new Indian state, with Ramnagar (on the opposite bank) as headquarters but with no jurisdiction over the city of Varanasi. In 1947, after Indian independence, the Varanasi state became part of the state of Uttar Pradesh.",

      "description": "Kashi, India, has grown both in size and population. At around 28.5 square miles, the metro area is significantly larger than most American cities. There is an average of 72 people living in every square acre, making it one of India's densest urban areas (1951 Census). The city's population in 1971 was 5, 88,608. In 1951, there were roughly 43,865 homes within the city limits; today, that number has risen to far over 45,000. In the major eulogy Sanskrit text of Kāshi, the Kāshi Khand, the virtuous King Divodāsa made Kāshi the capital of his kingdom after Shiva and all the Devas had left the city. Eventually Shiva and his wife Pārvati, who lived in the mountains, no longer wanted to live away from their homely abode Kāshi. But it was difficult to attack such a flawless king. Shiva realised: only when King Divodāsa would fall, he and other gods would get resort in the ordered and  holy city of Kāshi. So in order to create a crisis in the city and dislodge Divodāsa from Kāshi Shiva sent sixty-four Yoginis (“assisting goddesses”) who entered the city. Being thrilled by the cosmic order and sacred power of the city, they settled down there. Similarly, other gods, planetary divinities, goddesses, demi-gods, assisting divine beings, and divine vehicle-animals in their different forms, all went there and settled down. Only after a cycle of time was completed, Shiva and Pārvati returned home on Vishnu's appeal and took up residence again in Kāshi. Eventually, Divodāsa himself worshipped Shiva by installing a linga, which was later on known after him as Divodāseshvara. In the course of time the varieties and different groups of goddesses and gods came to support Shiva and to enjoy the sacred power of the city. The story of King Divodāsa goes back to the Vedas and in the course of time was modified in the purānic literature to fit the local traditions and the rulers. In the Vedas a king named Divodāsa is mentioned in association with Indra's destruction of a hundred cities but it is difficult to accept the same figure as king of Kāshi/Vārānasi. In the Mahābhārata Divodāsa is described who had fortified the city of Vārānasi and also taken away the sacrificial fire of his enemies. This act resulted in conflict with Shiva who wished to dwell there Singh, R. P., Singh, R. S., & Rana, P. S. (2010). This is where you'll find the well-known Vishwanath Temple. The city's most upmarket shopping district can be found along the winding gall that leads to the Vishwanath temple. The central mandi (wholesale grain trade) of Varanasi is located in Visessarganj, which takes its name from the original Visheshwara shrine. The wholesale market for Banarsi sarees is located between Vishwanath gali and Visessarganj, and you can also find many more types of arts and crafts for which Benaras is known. Additionally, all of the ancient bathing ghats and the most revered Sanskrit pathashalas and mathas may be found within this arca. Thugs, gundas, and prostitutes coexist here with enlightened pandits, priests, ascetics, men of literature, and artists. Simply put, this region embodies the spiritual and secular soul of Kashi, the complete character of this ancient city. There are several distinct cultural enclaves within the pucca mahal, each of which is dominated by a different language family of Brahmins. So, there are Tamilian, Kannada, Andhra, Bengali, Maithil, Nepali, Gujarati, and Maharashtrian mohallas. This culturally diverse area is also home to the occasional Brahmin from Kashmir, Punjab, Sindh, Rajasthan, or elsewhere. Everywhere in the city, you'll undoubtedly run upon local Brahmins or Brahmins visiting from other regions of Uttar Pradesh. There are Khatris, Agarwals, Ahirs, Dome, and members of many more castes dispersed around the city. The Kashi population includes a sizeable number of Buddhists, Jains, and Sikhs. A small but significant number of Christians can also be found among the Muslims. Varanasi was once the center of spiritual education. It was called, SarvaVidya ki Rajdhani (the capital of knowledge of everything). Varanasi developed many scholars, intellects, and others in different fields.
